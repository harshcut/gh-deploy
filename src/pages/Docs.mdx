GitHub Deployments is an unofficial client for managing GitHub deployment environments. It uses official <Link rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://docs.github.com/en/rest">GitHub API</Link> and uses the same components and design guidelines of that of GitHub's design system with <Link rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://primer.style/">Primer</Link>.

### Deployments

Enter your username and repository to view your current deployments. Make sure your **repository is made public**, as github doesn't let you share details of your private repositories.

More information on repository visibility can be found <Link rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/setting-repository-visibility">here</Link>.

### Personal Access Token

Personal access tokens (PATs) are an alternative to using passwords for authentication to GitHub when using the GitHub API or the command line.

_As a security precaution, GitHub automatically removes personal access tokens that haven't been used in a year._

To create your personal access token head to github account **Settings** and then **Developer Settings**. In the left sidebar, click **Personal Access Tokens**. Click on **Generate New Token**, and give your token a descriptive name. From the checkboxes below, select the one with <Label bg="#0366d6">repo_deployment</Label>. Click **Generate Token**.

Copy the token to your clipboard and keep it safe. You will not be able to see the token again, after you navigate off the page.

  <Text fontSize={1} as="p">
    For security reasons delete the token after your task is complete, as you
    can recreate them anytime you want. Treat your tokens like passwords and
    keep them secret.

### Data Updates

GitHub takes time to change the API response for the deleted deployment. Hence, the **results may be delayed** and may produce conflict. Make sure to reload the data or refresh the page.

This may be improved in the future updates.
